In my work as a consultant prior to building Byword, I'd typically deliver thousands of articles to brands. A question I'd often get asked is:

> How am I supposed to edit & review thousands of these?

This question is completely understandable in a traditional SEO context, but when using AI to generate large-scale content projects, we need to look at things from a different perspective.

## Prioritizing by traffic

When dealing with thousands of pages, it's simply not viable to edit all of them prior to publishing.

<Note>
SEO is a long-term game, and the benefits of having pages rank sooner will likely outweigh the costs of having unedited content live initially.
</Note>

Equally important, most brands can't afford the resources required to edit such large volumes of content.

This is why my advice is typically to:
1. Publish the content without initial editing
2. Monitor which pages start to rank and generate traffic
3. Prioritize your editing efforts based on what's generating the most traffic

This approach offers several advantages:

- **Faster indexing and ranking** - By publishing content immediately, pages can get indexed and begin generating traffic as quickly as possible
- **Resource efficiency** - You avoid spending time editing pages that may never deliver SEO value
- **Data-driven prioritization** - You can focus your quality improvement efforts where they'll have the greatest impact

<Warning>
This approach will have some false negativesâ€”pages that would've ranked well with proper editing but don't get the chance. However, this is a small price to pay for the benefits that SEO at scale can bring.
</Warning>

## A low-risk strategy

Some people object to this approach because they don't want anything live that might compromise their brand voice or image.

This is a fair concern, though the risk is significantly lower than you might expect. The approach I advocate is to:

1. Let pages rank organically
2. Set a traffic threshold (e.g., 100 sessions)
3. Immediately prioritize content for human review and editing once it crosses that threshold

<Tip>
This strategy significantly mitigates risk exposure to just a small number of sessions, while still capturing the benefits of quick publishing and ranking.
</Tip>

By setting proper monitoring and thresholds, you can:
- Get content ranking more quickly
- Avoid wasting resources on content that won't perform
- Ensure high-traffic content receives proper attention
- Maintain brand quality where it matters most

## Implementation workflow

To implement this strategy effectively:

1. Set up traffic threshold alerts in your analytics platform
2. Create a prioritized editing queue based on traffic metrics
3. Establish a streamlined editing process for high-performing content
4. Consider using Byword's regeneration features to quickly improve underperforming content

This "rank first, edit second" approach is essential for maximizing the ROI of large-scale AI content production.
