This guide will help you create your first SEO-optimized article in just a few minutes. Follow these simple steps to go from setup to published content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your account settings">
    Before diving in, take a moment to configure your article settings on your [settings page](https://byword.ai/settings). Here you can:

    * Customise your article length and language

    * Set your brand voice and writing style preferences
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up integrations (Optional)">
    Want to publish directly to your website? Visit the [integrations page](https://byword.ai/integrations) to connect with:

    * WordPress

    * Webflow

    * Zapier

    * API access

    Integrations allow for seamless publishing without copy-pasting, but this step is optional. You can always export content manually later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first article">
    Now for the fun part! Head to the [Create page](https://byword.ai/create) and:

    1. Select "Single Articles" from the content options

    2. Enter a keyword you want to rank for (e.g., "best protein powder for muscle gain")

    3. Click "Generate Article"

    Byword will automatically research your topic and generate a comprehensive, SEO-optimized article.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and publish">
    Once your article is generated, you can:

    * Review the content

    * View it on your CMS (if you've set up an integration)

    * If you prefer manual publishing, click the gear icon and select your preferred format (HTML, Markdown, or plain text) to copy

    That's it! Your first SEO-optimized article is ready to drive traffic to your site.
  </Step>
