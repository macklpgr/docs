The [Performance](https://byword.ai/performance) dashboard provides valuable insights into how your content is performing in search engines. This powerful analytics feature helps you monitor your rankings, identify optimization opportunities, and improve your content to drive more organic traffic.

## Overview

The Performance dashboard gives you a comprehensive view of your site's search performance, including:

* Search visibility trends over time

* Page-level performance metrics

* Search query analysis

* Content optimization opportunities

## Key features

### Performance metrics

Track important SEO metrics for your content:

* **Clicks**: Number of times users clicked through to your content from search results

* **Impressions**: How often your content appeared in search results

* **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Percentage of impressions that resulted in clicks

* **Position**: Average ranking position in search results

### Performance tabs

The dashboard offers three different views to analyze your performance:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pages">
    Shows performance metrics for individual pages on your site. This view helps you identify which content is performing well and which needs improvement.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Queries">
    Displays the search terms that are driving traffic to your site. This helps you understand which keywords are most effective for your content.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Opportunities">
    Highlights queries where your content is ranking outside the top 3 positions. These represent potential optimization targets to improve your rankings.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Content optimization

The Performance dashboard doesn't just show analyticsâ€”it actively helps you improve your content with the "Generate" feature:

1. Identify queries with ranking potential (typically in positions 4-20)

2. Click "Generate" next to the target query

3. Byword will analyze the query and your content

4. A popup appears with optimization suggestions

5. Choose between different optimization modes:

   * Generate sentences

   * Generate paragraphs

   * Generate sections

6. Review the generated content and use the "Copy text" button to add it to your article

7. If needed, use the "Regenerate" option to get alternative suggestions

<Info>
  The optimization feature uses AI to create content that helps your page better match search intent for specific queries, potentially improving your rankings.

## Using performance data effectively

### Identify content gaps

Review queries where you're ranking but not in top positions. These represent topics your audience is interested in that you could address more thoroughly.

### Track improvement over time

Use the date range selector (default: Last 30 Days) to monitor how your content performance changes after making optimizations.

### Prioritize optimization efforts

Focus on:

* High-impression, low-CTR content (compelling topic but weak title/description)

* Queries with high search volume where you rank on page 1 but not in the top 3

* Pages that have recently dropped in rankings

## Best practices

* **Regular monitoring**: Check your performance dashboard weekly to spot trends

* **Strategic optimization**: Focus on queries with commercial intent for revenue-driving pages

* **Balanced approach**: Don't over-optimize for a single keyword; address related queries as well

* **Content freshness**: Update high-potential pages with new information and optimized content

* **Test and iterate**: Track changes in rankings after implementing optimizations
