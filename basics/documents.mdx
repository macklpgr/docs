Byword's Documents feature allows you to upload custom materials that provide additional context and expertise for AI-generated content. By integrating your specialized knowledge, Byword creates more accurate, relevant content that reflects your brand's unique perspective.

## What are documents?

Documents are files, URLs, text, or audio that contain specialized information you want Byword to reference when generating content. This additional context helps create articles that go beyond generic information and incorporate your specific knowledge.

<Info>
  When you share materials with Byword, it references this information while writing, incorporating specific facts and expertise that generic AI doesn't have.
