Byword allows you to export your generated content in bulk as CSV files. This provides flexibility for using your AI-generated content in external systems, content management platforms, or for offline storage and analysis.

## Export capabilities

Each CSV export contains comprehensive data for your selected articles:

* Article titles

* Full article content

* Meta descriptions

* Image URLs

* Generation dates

* All associated metadata

## Content formats

CSV exports include your content in multiple formats to accommodate different needs:

* **HTML**: Complete with formatting tags for direct web publishing

* **Markdown**: Perfect for platforms that support markdown

* **Plaintext**: Clean text without formatting for maximum compatibility

This multi-format approach gives you flexibility when importing to different systems.

## How to export content

There are two primary methods for exporting your Byword content as CSVs:

### Method 1: Export selected articles

To export specific articles:

1. Navigate to your "My Content" page

2. Select individual articles by selecting the boxes next to them

3. Click the "Download" button at the top of the section

4. A CSV file containing only your selected articles will be generated and downloaded

### Method 2: Export entire campaigns

To export all articles in a campaign:

1. Navigate to your "My Content" page

2. Locate the campaign you want to export, and click on it

3. Click the "Download" button at the top of the screen

4. A CSV file containing all articles in that campaign will be generated and downloaded

<Tip>
  Campaign exports are ideal for backing up entire content campaigns or transferring complete datasets to other platforms.

## CSV structure

The exported CSV includes data for:

* The article headline

* The article meta description

* The full article in HTML format

* The full article in Markdown format

* The full article in plain text

* Link to the generated header image

* When the article was created

* Which campaign the article belongs to

* The keyword used to generate the article

## Working with exported CSVs

### Importing to content platforms

The multi-format content allows you to choose the best format for your target platform:

* Use HTML for direct import to most CMSs

* Use Markdown for platforms like Ghost, Jekyll, or Notion

* Use Plaintext as a base for custom formatting

### Spreadsheet compatibility

When opening CSV exports in spreadsheet applications:

<Warning>
  Users sometimes experience character encoding issues when saving CSVs in Excel and then importing into Google Sheets. If you notice unexpected characters in your exported articles, try re-downloading and importing directly to your final tool.
</Warning>

For best results:

* Import directly to your final tool when possible

* Use UTF-8 encoding settings when opening in Excel

* Consider using specialized CSV editors for large exports

## Bulk processing

The CSV format makes it easy to:

* Add additional metadata columns

* Apply bulk changes to content

* Filter articles based on criteria

* Sort and organize content

* Prepare content for import to specialized platforms

## Use cases

Common ways to use CSV exports:

* Creating content backups

* Migrating content between platforms

* Analyzing content metrics and patterns

* Preparing content for manual review before publishing

* Sharing content with team members without Byword access

* Bulk importing to custom CMS platforms
