description: "Retrieve articles created via the Create Article endpoint"
---

This endpoint allows you to retrieve articles created via Create Article. Articles typically take around 60 seconds to generate, so it's recommended to call this API at 5 second intervals until the endpoint returns a response with all of the article's fields.

## Request

<ParamField body="key" type="string" required>
  Your Byword API key. Can be found [here](https://byword.ai/integrate-api).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="articleID" type="string" required>
  The ID of the article that was returned from the Create Article endpoint.
</ParamField>

## Response

The response will contain all of the article's fields when ready. While the article is still generating, you may receive a partial response.

## Examples

{
  "key": "your_api_key_here",

### Implementation Notes

- Articles typically take around 60-120 seconds to generate, but this can vary based on length and complexity.
- It's recommended to poll this endpoint at 5-second intervals until you receive a complete response.
- Consider implementing an exponential backoff strategy for production applications.
