Byword's Webflow integration enables automatic syncing of your AI-generated content directly to Webflow CMS collections. This streamlines your content workflow by eliminating manual copy-pasting between platforms.

## Integration setup

Setting up the Webflow integration involves three main steps:

### Step 1: Provide an API key

1. Navigate to the [Webflow integration page](https://byword.ai/integrate-webflow) in your Byword account

2. You'll be prompted to enter your site's API key

3. To find your API key:

   * Go to your Webflow dashboard

   * Navigate to the site settings

   * Open the Integrations tab

   * Generate a token under API Access

<Warning>
  Webflow will not display your API key again after generation. Save it securely or be prepared to generate a new one if needed.
</Warning>

1. Enter your API key in Byword and click "Verify"

### Step 2: Choose your CMS collection

After verifying your API key:

1. Select which CMS collection you want to sync your articles to

2. For most sites, this will be the collection used for blog posts

3. Byword will display your site name in italics to confirm the connection

### Step 3: Configure CMS settings

Finally, configure how Byword should interact with your Webflow CMS:

#### Live site status

Choose where your content should be published:

* **Post to staging only**: Content will only be visible in your Webflow Editor until manually published (default)

* **Post to live site**: Content will be published directly to your live site

#### Field mapping

This critical section tells Byword which Webflow fields correspond to:

1. **Article Title**: Automatically mapped to the default "Name" field in Webflow

2. **Article Body**: Must be mapped to a rich text field (required)

3. **Meta Description**: Can be mapped to any text field (optional)

4. **Image**: Can be mapped to an image field (optional)

<Info>
  Only the Article Body mapping is required. Meta description and image mappings are optional but recommended for complete content.
</Info>

## Working with your integration

### Automatic syncing

Once set up, new articles will automatically sync to your Webflow collection as they're generated in Byword.

### Manual syncing

You can also manually sync articles to Webflow in two ways:

#### For individual articles:

1. Go to "My Content" in Byword

2. Select the articles you want to sync

3. Click the integration button in the top right of the page

#### For entire campaigns:

1. Navigate to any campaign page in "My Content"

2. Click the Webflow button (or "Sync to Site" if you have multiple integrations)

3. This will sync the entire campaign to Webflow

<Warning>
  Manual syncs cannot be paused or canceled once started. The process takes approximately 1-2 seconds per article.
</Warning>

## Best practices

For optimal results with the Webflow integration:

1. **Field structure**: Ensure your Webflow collection has appropriate fields (rich text, plain text, image) before setting up the integration

2. **Staging first**: Initially use the "Post to staging only" option to verify content appears correctly

3. **Image handling**: If using images, verify they're being properly uploaded and displayed

4. **Content verification**: After initial sync, check that formatting is preserved correctly in Webflow

## Troubleshooting

If your Webflow integration isn't working as expected:

* Verify your API key is still valid

* Ensure the selected CMS collection exists and is correctly configured

* Check field mappings correspond to the right field types

* For persistent issues, try resetting the integration using the "Reset" button at the top of the page

## Reconnecting or changing settings

If you need to change your integration settings:

1. Click the "Reset" button at the top of the Webflow integration page

2. You'll be guided through the setup process again

3. This allows you to change your API key, collection, or field mappings
