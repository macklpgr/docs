Custom prompts give you advanced control over Byword's writing algorithm by allowing you to add specific instructions that influence the content generation process.

## How custom prompts work

Custom prompts act as specialized instructions that guide Byword's writing process. You can add up to three custom prompts of 160 characters each through your account settings page.

<Info>
  Think of custom prompts as style guidance that shapes how Byword approaches your content, beyond the basic writing style settings.

## Understanding prompt limitations

Custom prompts enhance your control but have important limitations:

<Warning>
  Custom prompts influence but don't guarantee specific outcomes. They help steer content in your preferred direction but won't override Byword's core writing algorithms.
</Warning>

### Key considerations

* **Timing matters**: Prompts are applied when you click "Generate" - changing prompts afterward won't affect articles already in the queue

* **Less is more**: Using fewer, focused prompts often yields better results than multiple competing instructions

* **Length affects compliance**: Shorter articles tend to follow custom prompts more consistently than longer ones

## Writing effective prompts

The way you phrase your prompts significantly impacts their effectiveness. Follow these best practices:

### Do's and don'ts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Recommended approaches">
    * Use direct instructional language

    * Focus on one clear instruction per prompt

    * Be specific about what you want

    * Phrase positively rather than negatively
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Less effective approaches">
    * Using polite requests ("please could you...")

    * Writing declarative statements ("this article should have...")

    * Including negations ("do not include...")

    * Competing or contradictory instructions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Effective prompt examples

> *Explain technical concepts with real-world analogies*
> *Include practical examples for each main point*
> *Structure content as a step-by-step guide with actionable advice*
> *Address common objections or misconceptions in each section*
> *Use data points and statistics to support key claims*

## Prompts to avoid

Certain types of instructions work better through other Byword features:

* **Tone adjustments**: "Write in an engaging voice" → Use the Writing Style feature instead

* **Language changes**: "Write in Spanish" → Use the Languages feature instead

* **CTAs**: "Include a CTA for my product" → Use the dedicated CTA feature

* **Structure manipulation**: "Include 1 H3 for every H2" → Structure is determined earlier in generation

* **External linking**: "Include links to..." → Byword cannot reliably insert external links

* **Keyword placement**: "Insert the keyword in..." → Variables like 'keyword' aren't accessible to prompts

## Optimizing your prompt strategy

For best results:

1. **Start simple**: Begin with one clear prompt that addresses your most important need

2. **Test and refine**: Generate test articles to see how well your prompts are followed

3. **Adjust by topic**: Different content topics may benefit from different custom prompts

4. **Consider article length**: Use more focused prompts for longer articles where drift can occur

<Tip>
  Custom prompts work best when they enhance rather than override Byword's core capabilities. Focus on stylistic guidance, content approach, and perspective rather than technical formatting.
