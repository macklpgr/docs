Byword's CTA feature automatically generates compelling calls to action at the end of your articles, encouraging readers to engage with your product or service.

<Tip>
  Well-crafted CTAs can significantly increase conversion rates by providing clear next steps for readers who are already engaged with your content.

## How Byword CTAs work

Byword generates unique, contextually relevant CTAs based on information you provide about your brand. These CTAs are placed at the end of your articles, creating a natural transition from educational content to conversion opportunity.

## Setting up your CTA

To create your first CTA:

1. Navigate to the CTA section in your Byword dashboard
2. Find the CTA creation form at the bottom of the page
3. Fill in the required information about your brand and offering
4. Click "Create CTA" to save your configuration

### CTA configuration options

<Accordion title="CTA name">
  An internal label to help you identify this CTA if you create multiple versions. This doesn't appear in your content.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Brand name">
  Your company, product, or service name exactly as you want it to appear in the CTA. Be precise with capitalization and formatting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Action">
  The specific action you want readers to take, such as:
  - Sign up
  - Book a demo
  - Start your free trial
  - Shop now
  - Learn more
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="URL (optional)">
  The destination where readers should go after clicking your CTA. Include the full URL with the https:// prefix. You can add UTM parameters for tracking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Heading">
  Choose whether your CTA appears under its own subheading or flows as a paragraph at the end of the article.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Description">
  Provide detailed context about your offering to help Byword create effective CTAs. Consider including:
  
  - What your product/service does
  - Who it's designed for
  - Key benefits or unique selling points
  - Pricing information (if relevant)
  - Special offers or guarantees
  - Social proof elements
</Accordion>

## Managing your CTAs

After creating a CTA, it will appear in your CTA list and be automatically enabled. You can:

- **Enable/disable CTAs**: Only one CTA can be active at a time
- **Edit CTAs**: Update any field to refine your messaging
- **Delete CTAs**: Remove CTAs you no longer need
- **Create multiple CTAs**: Build a library of different CTAs for various purposes

<Warning>
  If all CTAs are disabled, your articles will be generated without a call to action section.
</Warning>

## Switching CTAs for different content

You can change which CTA is used directly from any article generation page, allowing you to tailor your conversion strategy to specific content themes or audience segments.

## Best practices for effective CTAs

- **Be specific**: Clearly state what users will get by taking action
- **Create urgency**: Consider including time-limited offers or emphasizing immediate benefits
- **Match your tone**: Ensure your CTA description aligns with your brand voice
- **Test different approaches**: Create multiple CTAs and compare their effectiveness
- **Update regularly**: Refresh your CTAs to reflect your current offerings and promotions
