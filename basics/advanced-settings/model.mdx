## Available models

### OpenAI - GPT4.5

The original model that has powered Byword since launch:

## Choosing the right model

Your model selection affects all content generated through your account. Consider these factors when choosing:

* **Content style**: If you prioritize a more human-sounding, natural flow, Claude Sonnet is recommended
