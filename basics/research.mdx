Byword's [Research](https://byword.ai/research) feature provides integrated keyword research capabilities directly within the platform. It allows you to discover relevant keywords, organize them into keyword lists, and seamlessly send them to the [Campaign Builder](https://byword.ai/create-campaign) for content creation.

## How it works

The Research tool offers three flexible ways to discover keywords:

### Input options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Seed keyword">
    Enter a single keyword relevant to your site or brand, and Byword will return a comprehensive list of related keywords.

    Example: "protein powder"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Parametrized keyword">
    Use wildcards to find specific keyword patterns. Insert an asterisk (\*) to represent any word that could appear in that position.

    Example: "best \* shoes" will find "best running shoes," "best hiking shoes," etc.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Domain analysis">
    Enter a root domain (without http/https or subpages), and Byword will identify keywords that are relevant to that website.

    Example: "webmd.com"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Analyzing keyword data

After submitting your input, Byword displays a list of relevant keywords along with valuable metrics:

<Info>
  The table includes key metrics to help you evaluate each keyword's potential value for your content strategy.
</Info>

* **Search Volume**: Estimated monthly search volume

* **Trend**: Visual sparkline showing the last 12 months of search volume data

* **Difficulty**: Score from 0-100 indicating ranking difficulty (derived from PPC metrics)

Each keyword also has an "Add" button to include it in your selected keyword list.

## Using keyword lists

Keyword lists help you organize related keywords for specific content projects or topics.

### Creating and managing keyword lists

1. Click "Manage Keyword Lists" in the top right of the research screen

2. Select "Create New Keyword List" from the dropdown

3. Name your list based on your content category or campaign

4. Keywords already in your selected list will be highlighted

<Tip>
  Create separate keyword lists for different content themes, product categories, or sales funnels to keep your content strategy organized.
</Tip>

## Generating content from your research

Once you've built a keyword list, you can send it directly to Byword's Campaign Builder:

1. Click "Manage Keyword Lists" in the top right

2. Select your desired list

3. Click "Preview in Campaign Builder"

<Info>
  The "Preview in Campaign Builder" action doesn't consume article credits or automatically start generation. It simply pre-fills your keyword list into the Campaign Builder for review.

## Usage limits by plan

Your Research tool usage is determined by your Byword subscription level:

| Plan      | Monthly search limit |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| No plan   | 3 searches           |
| Starter   | 25 searches          |
| Standard  | 80 searches          |
| Scale     | 300 searches         |
| Unlimited | 500 searches         |

<Warning>
  Search usage resets on the 1st of each month, regardless of when your billing cycle renews.
</Warning>

## Best practices

* **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with broad seed keywords, then refine using the more specific keywords you discover

* **Look for trends**: Use the trend sparkline to identify seasonal keywords or growing topics

* **Balance volume and difficulty**: Target a mix of high-volume competitive terms and lower-difficulty keywords

* **Group thematically**: Create keyword lists that represent a single cohesive topic to generate more focused content

* **Prioritize intent**: Group keywords by user intent (informational, commercial, transactional) to create content for different stages of the buyer's journey
