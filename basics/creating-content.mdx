Byword offers multiple ways to create SEO-optimized content quickly and efficiently. This guide covers everything you need to know about generating articles, from single articles to large-scale campaign creation with custom structures.

## Content creation options

When you visit the [Create Content](https://byword.ai/create) screen, you'll have three main options for creating content:

### Single articles

The Single Article Generator lets you create articles one-by-one with fine control, watching them appear in front of your eyes.

<Info>
  Single articles are ideal for testing out content or creating articles individually with maximum control over the output.
</Info>

To use the Single Article Generator:

1. Go to the Create Content screen and select "Single articles"

2. Choose your creation mode (Keywords, Titles, or Titles & Subheadings)

3. Enter your keyword or title in the input field

4. Click the **Generate** button

5. Wait about 60 seconds for Byword to create your article

6. Review your article with its AI-generated image(s)

Remember that each article generation requires 1 credit, although users on plans are able to rewrite the article with custom instructions as many times as they want.

### Campaign builder

The Campaign Builder allows you to scale content production by creating tens, hundreds, or thousands of articles with just a few clicks.

<Info>
  Use the Campaign Builder when you need to create many articles in bulk as quickly as possible.
</Info>

To use the Campaign Builder:

1. Go to the Create Content screen and select "Campaign builder"

2. Enter a campaign name (this only affects how it appears in your account)

3. Select your campaign type: Keywords, Titles, or Titles & Subheadings

4. Input your list of keywords or titles in the text area that appears

   * Enter one keyword/title per line

5. Verify that the system has detected all your inputs correctly

6. Check that you have enough credits for your campaign

7. Start the campaign to begin the content creation process

Once your campaign begins, the process runs in the background, and you'll receive an email notification when your project is complete.

## Article creation modes

Byword offers three different modes for creating articles, each providing a different level of control over the output.

### Keyword Mode

Keyword mode is designed to be a quick and elegant way to create content. You simply enter a keyword you'd like to rank for, and Byword handles the rest, generating both a relevant title and content based on that keyword.

<Info>
  A keyword is a word or phrase that a user inputs into a search engine. It can be a single word (*flights*) or multiple words (*how to find cheap flights*).
</Info>

**When to use Keyword Mode:**

* When you don't have a fully formed idea of what article title you want, but know what your target audience is searching for

* When you have a list of keywords from research tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, etc.) and prefer to let Byword create the titles

* If you need help finding keywords, click the "Help me find a keyword" link for assistance

**When not to use Keyword Mode:**

* If you already have your article titles prepared

* If you're planning to input a large number of keywords and want articles that all follow a certain structure (consider Title Mode instead)

### Title Mode

Title mode works perfectly when you already know what you want your article to be called. Simply provide your title, and Byword will handle creating the content.

<Info>
  Your title will appear in the final article as an H1 (heading 1), serving as the most prominent signal to both search engines and readers about what your page covers.
</Info>

**When to use Title Mode:**

* When you already have your titles written out

* When you want to guide Byword toward a specific content direction (e.g., creating a glossary entry with a title like "Interest Rates: Finance Explained")

**When not to use Title Mode:**

* If you don't know what title you want (consider Keyword Mode instead)

* If you need even more structure control (consider Title + Subheadings Mode)

### Titles & Subheadings Mode

Titles & Subheadings mode gives you maximum control over your content structure. You specify both the title and a list of subheadings that Byword will use when creating the article.

<Info>
  Each subheading will be repeated verbatim in the final article, so enter them exactly as you want them to appear. Don't use instructions like "*talk about pacing in marathons*"; instead use proper headings like "*The Effect of Pacing on Marathon Performance*".
</Info>

**When to use Titles & Subheadings Mode:**

* When you want maximum control over article content and structure

* When you know exactly what sections your article should include

**When not to use Titles & Subheadings Mode:**

* When you're short on time and prefer Byword to handle the outline

* For most bulk content creation (unless using advanced campaign features)

## Advanced campaign features

### Titles & Subheadings in Campaign Builder

For campaigns using the Titles & Subheadings mode, you'll need to provide a list of titles with their associated subheadings. To use this feature:

1. Select the Titles & Subheadings campaign type

2. Enter each article's information in the following format:*Title;Subheading1;Subheading2;Subheading3;Subheading4*

3. Place each article on a new line

The easiest way to prepare these strings is in Excel or Google Sheets. The Campaign Builder will show you how many articles it detects in your input, so verify this matches your expectations.

### Specifying subheading type

By default, Byword treats your subheadings as H2s (occasionally adding H3s where appropriate). For more control, you can specify whether specific subheadings should be H2s or H3s:

*Title;H2:Subheading1;H3:Subheading2;H2:Subheading3;H3:Subheading4*

<Info>
  When using Titles & Subheadings mode with custom article lengths, use this rule of thumb: aim for about 200 words per subheading for optimal content quality.
</Info>

Byword may add additional H3s to meet article length targets where appropriate.

  You can see an example of how to format this sort of string in Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BGPQjhdtt-XbGi2lHIQW2y27PIIU_ZxLhe86_4PncqQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

## Best practices

Here are some tips for getting the most out of Byword's content creation tools:

1. **Choose the right creation method**: Single articles for testing, campaigns for scale, and programmatic articles for specialized needs

2. **Select the appropriate mode**: Use Keywords, Titles, or Titles & Subheadings based on how much control you need

3. **Be specific with keywords**: The more specific your keyword, the more targeted your article will be

4. **Use clear titles**: Make sure your titles clearly communicate what the article is about

5. **Structure purposefully**: When using subheadings, create a logical flow that guides the reader

6. **Plan for scalability**: If creating multiple related articles, consider using similar structures for consistency

7. **Use content tools strategically**: Leverage specialized tools like the glossary builder or list generator for specific content types

8. **Review and optimize**: While Byword creates SEO-friendly content automatically, reviewing key elements can further improve performance

<Tip>
  For programmatic SEO campaigns, start with a small test campaign to ensure the output meets your expectations before scaling to hundreds or thousands of articles.
</Tip>

With Byword's powerful content creation tools, you can quickly build a library of SEO-optimized content that drives traffic to your site and provides value to your audience.
