## Language quality considerations

<Warning>
  While Byword supports multiple languages, content quality is typically highest in English. Non-English languages may show reduced quality with longer article lengths.
</Warning>

If you're exploring use cases in non-English languages, we recommend:

* Testing with your free credits first

* Starting with shorter article lengths

* Reviewing content carefully before publishing

* Providing feedback to help us improve our multilingual capabilities

## Use cases for multilingual content

* **International SEO**: Target keywords in local languages

* **Market expansion**: Reach new audiences in their native language

* **Content localization**: Adapt existing content for regional audiences

* **Multilingual blogs**: Create parallel content across language sites
