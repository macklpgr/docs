Each Byword article comes with AI-generated images to complement your content. The latest model (Flux - Oct 2024) delivers high-quality visuals that are uniquely generated for your content.

## Image style options

Byword offers two distinct image styles to match your content needs:

* **Illustrative**: Creates digital artwork and illustrations with clean lines and abstract elements

* **Photographic**: Generates more realistic, photo-like images

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Illustrative style">
    ![](/images/670d179d4ad95807ced8ac86.jpg)

    Illustrative images work well for:

    * Abstract concepts

    * Technical topics

    * Brand-focused content

    * Modern, clean aesthetics
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Photographic style">
    ![](/images/670d19d13a1ae049056fdba4\(1\).jpg)

    Photographic images work well for:

    * Product reviews

    * Travel content

    * Food-related articles

    * Topics that benefit from realism
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  You can switch between these image styles in your account [Settings](https://byword.ai/settings) page.

## Customization options

### File format

Choose between two file formats for your images:

* **.jpg** (default): Smaller file sizes (better for SEO), with compression options

* **.png**: Higher quality but larger file sizes

When using .jpg format, you can further customize:

<Accordion title="JPG quality settings">
  * **Prioritize filesize** (default): Creates images around 100-200KB, optimized for page speed

  * **Prioritize quality**: Generates less compressed images (500KB+) with better visual clarity
</Accordion>

<Warning>
  PNG files provide the best quality but can approach 1MB in size, which may impact page load speed.
</Warning>

### Aspect ratio

Byword offers both landscape and portrait aspect ratios:

* Square: 1:1

* Landscape options: 16:9, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4

* Portrait options: 9:16, 2:3, 3:4, 4:5

<Info>
  For portrait orientation (vertical images), the dimensions are flipped from their landscape counterparts.
</Info>

### Color scheme

Customize the colors in your generated images by specifying a color scheme in the settings:

<Accordion title="Color scheme best practices">
  For best results:

  * Use one or two colors

  * Include zero or one modifier per color

  * Keep descriptions simple

  **Good examples:**

  * orange

  * pastel orange

  * pastel blue and orange

  * pastel green and faded purple

  **Less effective examples:**

  * orange blue green white (too many colors)

  * deep rich ocean-like blue (too many modifiers)

  * generate in the style of andy warhol (not a color specification)
</Accordion>

### Images per article

Control how many images appear in your content:

* **1** (default): Header image only

* **2-4**: Header image plus additional inline images throughout the article

<Info>
  All inline images use the same aspect ratio as your header image. They're automatically positioned at logical breaks in your content.
</Info>

## Technical details

### Image styling

Images are styled with inline CSS using:

* `width: 100%`

* `max-width: 600px`

This ensures they align with your text width up to a maximum of 600 pixels.

### Integration support

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="WordPress">
    Images are automatically uploaded to your media library and set as the featured image for the article.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Webflow">
    Images are uploaded to whichever CMS collection field you specify during integration setup.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Zapier/API/CSV">
    These methods return the image asset URL in their results for you to handle as needed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Retrieving images

For HTML exports (both clipboard copies and CSV exports), images are not embedded directly. Instead:

* In the single article generator, right-click to copy or save the image

* In CSV exports, you'll receive links to the images

## Copyright

All images are generated by Byword's custom AI model, meaning:

* You don't need to worry about copyright or royalties

* Each image is unique to your article

* You won't find these images elsewhere online
