Byword lets you customize how long your generated articles should be, helping you create content that matches your SEO strategy and audience needs.

## Setting your target word count

You can set a target word count for your Byword articles between 500 and 3,000 words. Byword's algorithms will work to achieve your specified length while maintaining quality and relevance.

<Info>
  The default article length for new accounts is set to 1,500 words, which provides a good balance between comprehensiveness and quality.

## How to adjust article length

You can change your article length setting on your domain [settings page](https://byword.ai/settings).

  Regardless of the length you choose, each generated article counts as one article against your monthly plan limit. This is important to keep in mind when planning your content strategy.

## Length limitations

While Byword will aim to hit your target word count, it's important to understand:

- Word count targets are not guaranteed.
  - Byword will err on the side of overshooting your length target, as a safety measure. Byword articles typically come out with a length that's 5-10% longer than your requested article length.
- Some topics naturally have length limitations based on available information.

## Length, quality, and SEO

There's a common misconception that longer articles always perform better for SEO. While length can be beneficial in some cases, quality and relevance are far more important factors.

### What research shows

- Content should be comprehensive enough to satisfy user intent
- After 500-1,000 words, additional length doesn't automatically improve rankings
- Extremely long content can reduce engagement if it introduces irrelevance
- Google prioritizes quality and relevance over raw word count

<Tip>
  Match your article length to your topic and audience needs. Technical guides might benefit from 2,000\+ words, while simple how-to content might be more effective at 800-1,000 words.
</Tip>

## Optimizing your word count strategy

Consider these factors when determining your ideal article length:

- **Topic complexity**: More complex topics may require longer articles
- **User intent**: Informational queries often need more depth than transactional ones
- **Competitive landscape**: Check the average length of top-ranking articles for your keywords
- **Content quality**: A focused 800-word article is better than a 2,000-word article with filler
- **Reader experience**: Consider how willing your audience is to read longer content

Byword tends to produce higher quality output at moderate lengths, which is why we recommend starting with the default 1,500-word setting and adjusting based on your specific needs.
