## Frequently asked questions

<Accordion title="Is this really unlimited?">
  Yes! There are no limits imposed on Unlimited accounts.
  There is a soft limit in the sense that a dedicated Byword server is able to process a finite number of articles in a given time period, but this number is over 100,000 articles per month. If you think you might exceed this, please email mack@byword.ai.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does 'dedicated server space' mean?">
  When you use Byword on a regular account, you're running on the core Byword architecture. You share processing and writing power with all other users who are on Byword at any given point in time.
  Dedicated server space splits you off from everyone else, and gives you your own compute power dedicated to your articles, and your articles only. This means reliable, fast article generation times, letting you produce huge amounts of content in even a single hour.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need an OpenAI key?">
  You will need an OpenAI key to setup a self-serve Unlimited account.
  This is very easy to get though; it should only take a few minutes, and we have a guide to help walk you through the steps.
  You also have the option of adding a replicate.com key for image generation, though this is optional.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long does it take to setup a dedicated Byword server?">
  There is a small amount of manual work involved in spinning up a dedicated Byword server for self-serve users. We'll always have this completed within a business day of signup (usually much sooner though), and email you as soon as your account is ready.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How much does it cost to use the OpenAI API?">
  In the process of creating an OpenAI API key, you'll be asked to enter billing details on the OpenAI site. Your card will be charged a small amount by OpenAI to cover the GPU costs of each article.
  These can vary with your specific article settings, but are typically in the range of $0.025 to $0.10 per article.
  If you're cost conscious, you can disable Internal Linking, and opt not to use images in any Programmatic content you create. Adhering to both of these should bring the cost per article safely below $0.05.
